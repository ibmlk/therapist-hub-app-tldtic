This app will have features for therapist profiles, filtering, booking management, payments, authentication, dashboards for both therapists and a super admin, and chat support.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Client App:**\n    *   A home screen with a search bar to find therapists based on location, gender, and services.\n    *   Therapist profile pages with photos, descriptions, and real-time availability.\n    *   Booking management with payment integration.\n*   **Therapist App:**\n    *   Profile management.\n    *   Earnings dashboard.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007BFF` (Bright Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6C757D` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#FFC107` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E9ECEF` (Light Gray)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is a React Native + Expo 54 project.\n2.  **Navigation:** Set up basic tab navigation using Expo's `createBottomTabNavigator`. Create tabs for \"Home\" (client search), \"Bookings\" (client bookings), and \"Profile\" (client profile).\n3.  **Home Screen:** Create a basic home screen layout in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` with a search bar (can be a simple TextInput for now).\n4.  **Therapist Profile:** Create a dummy therapist profile screen. This can be a simple component that displays a static image and some text information.\n5.  **Booking Screen:** Create a placeholder booking screen.\n6.  **Profile Screen:** Create a placeholder profile screen.\n7.  **Styling:** Apply the color scheme defined above to the app's components. Use React Native's StyleSheet API for styling.\n8.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the app's purpose.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the app will have a basic structure with tab navigation and placeholder screens, styled with the defined color scheme.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-17T14:39:29.137889"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about building this massage service app, then read the current files and implement the changes."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for icon names and read more files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/homeData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
